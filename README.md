This model is built using a polynomial Naive Bayes classifier, trained on vectorized data produced through two distinct techniques.

In the first technique, the bag of words is transformed into vectors using the Count Vectorizer.

In the second technique, the same bag of words is transformed into vectors using the TF-IDF Vectorizer.
